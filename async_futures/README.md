# ASYNC and Futures
Futures is used in places were the code has to wait once, unlike 
condition variables which can be used multiple times. Future is used once.
Secondly, unlike a thread future can start an independent thread any allows use to get a handle which can be used to return a value. 

Future also allows either to start the job immediately or delay it or it depends on the executer.

We have a very very simple example in this directory.
